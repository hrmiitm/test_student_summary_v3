Student Summary v3

This repository contains a static HTML summary page for the provided student_data.csv. The index.html file is the GitHub Pages entry point and includes a small dataset overview, sample rows and an embedded histogram image.

Files you should have / provide:
- index.html  (main summary page)
- student_data.csv  (the input CSV used to generate the summary — must be present in the repo root)
- sample.png  (logo image already provided)
- historgram.png  (histogram image generated from the CSV)

Notes on generation:
- The CSV columns detected were: Student ID, Name, Math, Science, English, History, Total, Average, Grade
- Number of rows detected: 10
- Numeric columns: Math, Science, English, History, Total, Average
- A histogram image was generated using the first numeric column (Math) and saved as historgram.png.

What you (or CI) should do before publishing on GitHub Pages:
1. Place the generated historgram.png next to index.html (repo root) if it is not already present. In some workflows this is created in an output folder; move it to the repo root or update the <img> path in index.html.
2. Verify student_data.csv is present in the repository root if you want to regenerate charts.
3. Enable GitHub Pages for the repository (Settings → Pages → pick branch and folder root). The index.html file at the root will be served.

If you want, I can also provide the Python script used to generate the histogram and more charts, or embed the histogram directly into the page as an inline base64 image. Let me know which you prefer.
